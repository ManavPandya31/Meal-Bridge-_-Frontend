      title: "Daya Foundation NGO",
      story: `Daya Foundation is a grassroots NGO operating in urban slums of Ahmedabad. With MealBridge, they collect surplus food from weddings and community events. Their volunteers, mostly college students, deliver the food to underprivileged families living in makeshift homes. Before MealBridge, they struggled to find consistent food sources. Now, they serve meals to over 150 people daily.
MealBridge’s real-time pickup system has been a game changer for them. They’ve reduced food waste while fighting hunger. Their motto: “Serve with Dignity, Waste Nothing.”`,

      story: `StreetFeast is a youth-led animal welfare NGO. They feed stray dogs and cows in the outskirts of Vadodara using food sourced through MealBridge. Previously, volunteers pooled money to buy biscuits and leftover food. Now, they receive clean, untouched food from small restaurants and cafeterias.
MealBridge alerts them when food is available, saving time and money. They feed over 70 animals daily and have even expanded to nearby villages. They say, “Every creature deserves a full stomach.”`,

      title: "Amma Bhojan Trust",
      story: `Amma Bhojan Trust began with a simple idea—no elderly person should go to sleep hungry.
In the outskirts of Ahmedabad, a small group of volunteers started preparing food for the elderly.
They initially cooked at home and distributed meals to 8–10 people per day.
But as the need grew, so did their struggle to manage time, food supply, and logistics.
They wanted to expand, but lacked a reliable and sustainable source of food.
Then they discovered MealBridge.

Through MealBridge, they connected with local hostels, PGs, and marriage halls.
Every evening, they receive alerts when excess food is available nearby.
Their team picks up the food, inspects its quality, and repackages it in eco-friendly containers.
The food is then hand-delivered to elderly people living alone, many of whom are abandoned by families.

One such person is 76-year-old Sharda Ben, who hadn’t had a proper hot meal in days.
Now, she smiles every evening when a volunteer rings her bell with a meal box.
“I wait for these kids more than the food,” she says, teary-eyed.
The volunteers often sit with the seniors, listen to their stories, and treat them like family.

MealBridge has allowed the Trust to triple its reach—from 15 homes to 50+.
They’ve partnered with 12 food donors and built a reliable weekly pickup schedule.
This has also reduced food waste in the community.
“Before MealBridge, our efforts were heartfelt but scattered,” says Meera, the Trust’s founder.
“Now, we are organized, efficient, and scalable.”

Their team includes homemakers, students, and retired professionals.
MealBridge’s app helps them manage pickups, timings, and even get reviews from beneficiaries.
In winter, they also distribute blankets alongside meals, sourced through MealBridge’s donors.
During festivals, they deliver special sweets and snacks to bring joy to their elderly friends.

They dream of expanding this model to other cities in Gujarat.
Volunteers are now training new chapters in Vadodara and Rajkot.
With MealBridge, they’re not just feeding people—they’re rebuilding broken human connections.
Their story is a testament to the power of tech-enabled compassion.

"Food is just the beginning," Meera says.
"Companionship, dignity, and love are what really get delivered."
Every meal comes with a handwritten note or a smile, reminding elders that they are not forgotten.
Through MealBridge, the Amma Bhojan Trust has created a ripple of hope and humanity—one meal at a time.

      title: "Genorus Doner - Nirav Shah – Event Manager",
      story: `Nirav Shah has managed over 400 weddings, corporate events, and public gatherings in Gujarat.
For years, he witnessed mountains of untouched food getting tossed out after grand events.
Buffet trays filled with dal, paneer, rice, and sweets—clean, untouched, and wasted.
He always felt uncomfortable, but didn’t have a system to handle the leftovers.
Until one day, a bride’s father asked him, “Can this food be donated somehow?”
That conversation planted a seed in Nirav’s mind.

A month later, he discovered MealBridge through a fellow event planner.
He signed up and was surprised at how easy it was to start donating.
Now, MealBridge is a part of his standard event checklist.
He informs the NGO partners through the app before each event ends.

By the time the lights dim and the guests leave, a volunteer team arrives.
They pack and take away the food within 30–45 minutes.
Nirav’s staff helps them coordinate and load the packages.
The food is then delivered to orphanages, old-age homes, and street shelters.

Clients have started asking for this option in their event packages.
Some even feature the act in their thank-you speeches and photo albums.
“It gives a beautiful end to the celebration,” Nirav says.
He has helped save over 10,000 meals from going to waste in one year alone.

His favorite moment?
A bride’s mother hugging an NGO volunteer after the wedding and saying, “You’ve made this even more special.”
MealBridge has transformed Nirav’s business into a socially impactful brand.
His team feels more proud and motivated at every event they plan.

In 2024, Nirav partnered with MealBridge to create a campaign called “Celebrate & Share”.
It encourages all event planners in Gujarat to adopt post-event food donation.
He has hosted 4 workshops for other caterers, decorators, and planners.
The initiative now includes 25+ vendors who actively donate via MealBridge.

Nirav’s story proves that even in a lavish, fast-paced industry, compassion can find a home.
He’s a donor, yes—but more than that, he’s an enabler of kindness.
“People spend lakhs on weddings,” he says, “Why not spend a few minutes feeding someone with the same joy?”
Through MealBridge, he’s bridged a gap between abundance and need.

      title: "Genorus Doner - Roti House (Restaurant Chain)",
      story: `Roti House started as a single restaurant in Ahmedabad 12 years ago.
Known for their North Indian thalis and homely food, they now have 8 outlets across Gujarat.
Every night, their chefs noticed there was clean, surplus food that couldn’t be sold the next day.
Earlier, the food was discarded—even though it was still fresh and edible.
This always bothered Roti House's founder, Mr. Harshil Joshi.
He wanted to make a change, but wasn’t sure how to manage safe, timely donations.

In early 2024, he came across MealBridge.
He registered and onboarded all 8 Roti House branches within a week.
Now, every outlet packs its leftover food in hygienic containers.
At 10 PM sharp, NGO partners arrive for pickup coordinated through the app.

Each pickup is logged and tracked for safety and transparency.
The staff has been trained to follow MealBridge’s food safety guidelines.
Meals are delivered to slum communities, roadside shelters, and night school kids.
In 6 months, over 15,000 meals have been donated across their locations.

Customers began noticing a sticker on their bill: “Excess food goes to someone in need – via MealBridge.”
Many appreciated the initiative and even started volunteering themselves.
Some donated snacks, biscuits, or groceries to NGOs via the same platform.
It sparked a mini movement within the local food community.

Now, Harshil has launched a “Meal Match” campaign.
For every 50 thalis sold, Roti House donates 5 extra meals through MealBridge.
Staff morale is at an all-time high—chefs say they feel part of something bigger than cooking.
It has changed how the brand sees itself—not just as a restaurant, but a responsible citizen.

They even celebrated their 12th anniversary with a special “Serve First” event.
Instead of a party, the team served 1,000 meals at a shelter with NGO volunteers.
Harshil now advocates for food waste reduction at culinary schools and hotel associations.

He dreams of a Gujarat where every restaurant signs up for MealBridge.
“If every kitchen joined hands,” he says, “no one would sleep hungry.”
His story reminds us that change doesn’t always begin in boardrooms—it can start in a kitchen.`,

      story: `Meera runs a girls’ hostel in Rajkot. Every day, a lot of food from the hostel kitchen would go to waste. With MealBridge, she connected with a local NGO that picks up the excess food every evening.
She’s inspired her neighbors—two nearby hostels have joined as well. The students now take pride in their role, helping reduce waste and feed others. “Even a simple plate of dal-chawal can change a day,” Meera shares.`,
